# Introduction 

Static code analysis in Java CI (Continuous Integration) involves the automated examination of source code without executing it, aiming to identify potential issues, enforce coding standards, and improve overall code quality. This process is an integral part of the CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipeline, helping developers catch and rectify issues early in the development lifecycle.


# What is Java static code analysis 

Static code analysis in Java CI (Continuous Integration) refers to the automated process of examining source code for potential issues, adherence to coding standards, and other best practices without actually executing the code. This analysis occurs during the development pipeline and is typically triggered by code changes pushed to a version control system like Git. The goal is to catch and address issues early in the development process, facilitating the creation of high-quality and maintainable Java applications.
