# Introduction 

Java CI code compilation in the context of checking in code. Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice that emphasizes frequent integration of code changes and automated testing. 

**Definition**: Continuous Integration is a development practice where developers frequently integrate their code changes into a shared repository. Each integration triggers automated processes such as builds, tests, and validations.

**Objective**: To detect and address integration issues early in the development process, ensuring a consistent and reliable codebase.


# Different Tools of java Complication 

In the Java ecosystem, there are several tools commonly used for compiling Java code. Here are some of the prominent ones

**1.Java Compiler (javac)**: The standard Java Compiler provided with the Java Development Kit (JDK). It is a command-line tool for compiling Java source code files (.java) into bytecode (.class) files.

**Example**

**2. Apache Maven**: A popular build automation and project management tool that can be used for compiling, testing, and packaging Java projects. Maven uses a declarative XML file (pom.xml) to manage project configurations.

**Example**

**3. Gradle**: Another build automation tool for Java that uses a Groovy-based DSL (Domain-Specific Language) or Kotlin for project configuration. It's designed to be flexible and supports incremental builds.

**Example**

**4. Ant**: A build tool similar to Maven but using XML-based configuration. It is an older tool that is still used in some projects.

**Example**

**Eclipse Compiler for Java** (ECJ): The Eclipse Foundation provides a Java compiler that is embedded in the Eclipse IDE. It can also be used as a standalone compiler.

**Example**

**6. IntelliJ IDEA Compiler**: If you're using IntelliJ IDEA as your integrated development environment, it has its own built-in compiler for Java.

Compiling is typically triggered automatically when you build or run your project within the IDE.
