# Introduction 

This documentation provides brief information on Authentication methods provided by Jenkins.

Jenkins is an automation server that is self-contained and open source. It allows the building, testing, and deployment of every software release cycle. Through its fleet of plugins (over 1700) that seamlessly integrate with most CI/CD tools, Jenkins offers flexibility and covers almost all functional requirements.

Access Control is the primary mechanism for securing a Jenkins environment against unauthorized usage. Two facts of configuration are necessary for configuring Access Control in Jenkins:

1. A Security Realm that informs the Jenkins environment how and where to pull user (or identity) information from. Also commonly known as Authentication.

2. Authorization configuration informs the Jenkins environment of which users and groups can access which aspects of Jenkins, and to what extent.


# What 

In Jenkins, authentication refers to the process of verifying the identity of users who are accessing the Jenkins server or interacting with Jenkins through its API. Jenkins supports various authentication mechanisms to control access to its resources and functionalities.  

# Why 

Authentication in Jenkins is important for several reasons:

|Components | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
|Security | Authentication ensures that only authorized users have access to Jenkins and its resources. By verifying the identity of users, Jenkins can prevent unauthorized access and protect sensitive information from being accessed or modified by malicious actors |
|Control Access |Different users may have different levels of access permissions within Jenkins based on their roles and responsibilities. Authentication allows administrators to enforce access controls and ensure that users only have access to the Jenkins functionalities and resources that are necessary for their tasks |
|Auditing and Accountability | Authentication provides a way to track and audit user activities within Jenkins. By identifying users through authentication, Jenkins can log user actions, such as who triggered a build or made configuration changes, helping administrators troubleshoot issues, track changes, and maintain accountability |
|Integration with External Systems |Jenkins often needs to integrate with external systems, such as version control systems, issue trackers, or build tools. Authentication ensures that Jenkins can securely authenticate with these external systems on behalf of users, allowing seamless integration without compromising security|
|Compliance Requirements | Many organizations have compliance or security policies that mandate proper authentication mechanisms to protect sensitive data and ensure regulatory compliance. By implementing robust authentication in Jenkins, organizations can meet these requirements and demonstrate adherence to security best practices |

# Authentication Method 

In Jenkins, various authentication methods are available to verify the identity of users accessing the Jenkins server or interacting with it through its API. Here are some common authentication methods in Jenkins:

|Security Ralm | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
|Jenkins Own Database | Jenkins has its user database where users can be created with usernames and passwords. Users authenticate themselves by providing their credentials when logging into Jenkins|
|LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) | Jenkins can integrate with LDAP servers, such as Microsoft Active Directory or OpenLDAP, to authenticate users against an existing directory service. This allows organizations to manage user accounts centrally |
|Single Sign-On (SSO) |Jenkins supports Single Sign-On solutions like SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) or OAuth, allowing users to authenticate once and access multiple services without needing to log in separately to each one |
|API Token Authentication |Jenkins provides API tokens that users can use for authentication when accessing Jenkins remotely via its REST API or CLI. These tokens are an alternative to passwords and can be generated and managed by users themselves |
|SSH Public Key Authentication |Jenkins supports SSH public key authentication for users who interact with Jenkins through Git or other version control systems via SSH |
|OpenID Connect | Jenkins can be configured to act as an OpenID Connect client, allowing users to authenticate using OpenID Connect providers.|
|Third-Party Authentication Plugins | Jenkins has a vast ecosystem of plugins, some of which provide additional authentication methods. For example, plugins may allow authentication against external identity providers or custom authentication mechanisms |

***
# Limitation

However, it's essential to consider the following considerations and potential limitations:

|Point	| Description |
|-------|-------------|
|Limited Integration |	Jenkins's built-in user database might not integrate as seamlessly with other systems compared to using external authentication providers like LDAP, Active Directory, or OAuth |
|Scalability Concerns	|For larger organizations or projects with complex authentication requirements, using an external identity provider might offer more scalability and flexibility.|
|Security Considerations |	Depending on the security policies of your organization, using an external identity provider might be preferred for centralized authentication and additional security features |

Ultimately, the choice between using Jenkins's user database and an external authentication system depends on the specific needs, scale, and security requirements of your Jenkins environment.


# Best practices of authentication of Jenkins 

Implementing secure authentication practices in Jenkins is crucial for maintaining the integrity of your CI/CD environment and protecting sensitive data. Here are some best practices for authentication in Jenkins:

|Practices | Description |
|----------|-------------|
|Use Strong Passwords | Encourage users to create strong passwords that are difficult to guess. Consider enforcing password complexity requirements, such as minimum length, and the inclusion of uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
|Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) | Enable multi-factor authentication to add an extra layer of security. Require users to provide a second form of authentication, such as a one-time code sent to their mobile device, in addition to their password |
|Regularly Rotate Credentials |Regularly prompt users to change their passwords and API tokens. Set up password expiration policies to enforce regular password changes, reducing the risk of credential compromise |
|Leverage External Authentication Providers| Integrate Jenkins with external authentication providers like LDAP, Active Directory, or SAML-based identity providers for centralized user management and authentication. This reduces the need for separate user accounts and enhances security.|
|Limit User Privileges | Follow the principle of least privilege and grant users only the permissions necessary to perform their tasks. Avoid granting excessive privileges that could lead to unintended actions or security breaches |
|Monitor User Activity | Enable auditing and logging features in Jenkins to monitor user activity. Regularly review audit logs to detect any suspicious behavior or unauthorized access attempts.|
|Secure Jenkins Master and Slave Communication | If using Jenkins distributed builds with master-slave configurations, ensure that communication between the Jenkins master and slaves is encrypted using protocols like SSH or SSL/TLS |
|Secure API Endpoints | Protect Jenkins API endpoints with appropriate authentication mechanisms and access controls. Use API tokens or OAuth tokens for authentication and authorize access based on user roles and permissions |
|Regularly Update Jenkins and Plugins |Keep Jenkins and its plugins up to date with the latest security patches and fixes. Vulnerabilities in outdated software could be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access |
|Educate Users |Provide training and awareness programs to educate users about security best practices, including password hygiene, recognizing phishing attempts, and safeguarding sensitive information |
|Implement Network Security Measures |Secure the network infrastructure hosting Jenkins servers to prevent unauthorized access. Use firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, and network segmentation to protect against external threats |
|Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing | Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in your Jenkins environment. Address any findings promptly to enhance overall security posture |
