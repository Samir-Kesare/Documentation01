# Introduction 

Logging metrics in Jenkins is crucial for monitoring and gaining insights into your Jenkins instance's performance, health, and usage. Jenkins provides various ways to capture and log 

metrics, including system logs, build logs, and plugins.

# What is logging  metrics in Jenkins?

Logging metrics in Jenkins involves capturing and recording specific quantitative measurements or data points related to the performance, health, and behavior of Jenkins. Logging metrics is crucial for monitoring and analyzing the state of your CI/CD pipeline, identifying potential issues, and making informed decisions about optimizations.

**Here are some common approaches to logging metrics in Jenkins**

|Name | Description|
|---------|--------|
|Custom Logging in Build Scripts|Developers can include custom logging statements within their build scripts (e.g., using shell or batch commands) to capture relevant metrics during the execution of a job.    For example, logging the start and end times of specific build steps, the duration of critical tasks, or the sizes of generated artifacts.|
|Jenkins Script Console|Use the Jenkins Script Console to run Groovy scripts that extract and log specific metrics.  Groovy scripts can access Jenkins API and extract information about builds, jobs, nodes, and other aspects of the Jenkins environment|
|Metrics Plugins|Jenkins provides plugins, such as the Metrics plugin, that allow you to expose and visualize custom metrics. Configure these plugins to capture and log specific metrics, and use visualization tools to analyze the data |
|Monitoring and Metrics Integration|Integrate Jenkins with external monitoring and metrics tools, such as Prometheus, Grafana, or Datadog. These tools often have Jenkins-specific plugins or integrations that facilitate the collection, aggregation, and visualization of metrics|
|Jenkins Performance Plugin| Use the Jenkins Performance Plugin to record and log performance-related metrics during build execution. This plugin is particularly useful for capturing data related to response times, build duration, and resource usage.
Custom Scripts and Logging:

Develop custom scripts using Jenkins Groovy scripting capabilities to extract and log specific metrics.
Log the extracted metrics to external files or systems for analysis.
Logging Frameworks:

Leverage logging frameworks within Jenkins plugins or custom scripts to record specific metrics.
Common logging frameworks used in Jenkins include Log4j and SLF4J.
