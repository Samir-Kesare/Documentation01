# What are logging  metrics in Jenkins?

Logging metrics in Jenkins involves capturing and recording specific quantitative measurements or data points related to the performance, health, and behavior of Jenkins. Logging metrics is crucial for monitoring and analyzing the state of your CI/CD pipeline, identifying potential issues, and making informed decisions about optimizations.


**Here are some common approaches to logging metrics in Jenkins**

|Name | Description|
|---------|--------|
|Custom Logging in Build Scripts|Developers can include custom logging statements within their build scripts (e.g., using shell or batch commands) to capture relevant metrics during the execution of a job.    For example, logging the start and end times of specific build steps, the duration of critical tasks, or the sizes of generated artifacts.|
|Jenkins Script Console|Use the Jenkins Script Console to run Groovy scripts that extract and log specific metrics.  Groovy scripts can access Jenkins API and extract information about builds, jobs, nodes, and other aspects of the Jenkins environment|
|Metrics Plugins|Jenkins provides plugins, such as the Metrics plugin, that allow you to expose and visualize custom metrics. Configure these plugins to capture and log specific metrics, and use visualization tools to analyze the data |
|Monitoring and Metrics Integration|Integrate Jenkins with external monitoring and metrics tools, such as Prometheus, Grafana, or Datadog. These tools often have Jenkins-specific plugins or integrations that facilitate the collection, aggregation, and visualization of metrics|
|Jenkins Performance Plugin| Use the Jenkins Performance Plugin to record and log performance-related metrics during build execution. This plugin is particularly useful for capturing data related to response times, build duration, and resource usage|
|Custom Scripts and Logging |Develop custom scripts using Jenkins Groovy scripting capabilities to extract and log specific metrics. Log the extracted metrics to external files or systems for analysis|
|Logging Frameworks| Leverage logging frameworks within Jenkins plugins or custom scripts to record specific metrics. Common logging frameworks used in Jenkins include Log4j and SLF4J|

|components | Description |
|------------|------------|
|Start | The process begins at the "Start" node, indicating the initiation of the Jenkins Java CI pipeline |
|Initiate Jenkins Build |The next step is to initiate the Jenkins build either manually or through an automated process, such as a webhook triggered by a code commit |
|Source Code Management|Jenkins pulls the source code from the configured version control system (e.g., Git).|
|Build Environment Setup |Set up the build environment, including any necessary dependencies and configurations required for the build process |
|Start Logging Metrics|Begin logging relevant metrics at the start of the build process|
|Build Execution |Execute the build steps defined in the Jenkins job, which typically involves tasks such as compiling Java code, running tests, and other specified actions.|
|Collect Build Metrics|Metrics related to the build process are collected during execution. Examples include build duration, queue length, executor utilization, and resource usage|
|Store Metrics Data |Store the collected metrics data in a designated location. This could involve writing logs to files or pushing data to external databases or monitoring systems|
|Post-Build Actions |After the build completes, perform any post-build actions, such as archiving artifacts, generating reports, and additional metric logging if necessary|
|Security Metrics |Include logging for security-related metrics, such as authentication failures and access attempts |
|Persist Logs|Ensure that logs, including metrics data, are persisted for future analysis and reference. This may involve archiving logs for historical purposes|
|Alerting and Monitoring|Implement alerting mechanisms based on critical metrics. Set up monitoring tools to detect anomalies and notify relevant stakeholders in case of issues|
|End | The process concludes at the "End" node.|
