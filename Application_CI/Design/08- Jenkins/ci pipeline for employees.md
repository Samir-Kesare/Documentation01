# Introduction 

A Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline for employee management typically involves a series of automated steps to ensure that changes to the employee management system are efficiently integrated, tested, and deployed. The pipeline typically starts with version control, where developers commit their code changes to a repository. Upon a new commit, the CI server automatically triggers a series of actions.

# Features

|Features|Description|
|---------|----------|
|Agent Configuration|This specifies that the pipeline can run on any available agent (slave node)|
| Stages | This section defines multiple stages for the pipeline |
|Code Checkout |This stage checks out the code from the specified GitHub repository OT-Employee using the 'main' branch and the specified credentials (employee-creds). As it is a private repo here, we are using credentials that are already stored in the Jenkin server|
|Dependency Scanning| It enhances the overall project security by proactively identifying and addressing potential risks associated with external dependencies|
|Static Code Analysis|Static code analysis helps identify and address potential issues, ensuring code quality|
| Unit Testing|This stage is dedicated to running unit tests for the project|
| Bug Analysis |It helps you catch potential problems early in the development process|
|Code Compilation|It helps to ensure the overall efficiency, quality, and reliability of software development|
