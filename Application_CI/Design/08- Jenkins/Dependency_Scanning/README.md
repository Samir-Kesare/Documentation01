## Introduction
Dependency scanning is a process used in software development to identify and analyze the external dependencies or third-party components that a project relies on. These dependencies can include libraries, frameworks, modules, packages, or other code modules that are utilized to build and run the software. 

The scanning process is typically automated and integrated into the development workflow, often as part of continuous integration or continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines. It serves as a crucial pre-build process examines the project's dependencies to identify any known vulnerabilities, outdated versions, or security issues.
