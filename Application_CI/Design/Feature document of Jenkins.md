## Introduction:
Jenkins is a widely-used open-source automation server designed to facilitate continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) in software development. It serves as the backbone of DevOps practices by automating various aspects of the software delivery lifecycle. Jenkins enables teams to streamline the build, test, and deployment processes, contributing to faster and more reliable software releases.

## Before Jenkins: Issues in Software Development

| Issues in Software Development | Problem | Impact |
|--------------------------------|---------|---------|
| **Manual Build and Deployment** | Manual build and deployment processes were error-prone | Inconsistencies between environments, deployment failures, and delays |
| **Lack of Continuous Integration** | Frequent integration of code changes was not standard | Longer feedback loops, difficulty identifying integration issues, slower response |
| **Limited Automation** | Repetitive tasks like testing and code analysis manual | Time-consuming manual testing, higher risk of errors, slower release cycles.|
| **Inefficient Collaboration** | 	Collaboration between teams (dev, test, ops) was siloed | Slow response times to issues, hindering overall software delivery |
| **Difficulty in Scalability** | Scaling development for larger codebases was challenging | Increased complexity, management overhead, especially in growing projects.|

***

**Note:** This table provides a clear overview of the issues in software development before the introduction of Jenkins, highlighting the problems and their corresponding impacts.
