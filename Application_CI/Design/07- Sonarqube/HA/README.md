## Introduction 
## What
High availability (HA) is the elimination of single points of failure to enable applications to continue to operate even if one of the IT components it depends on, such as a server, fails. IT professionals eliminate single points of failure to ensure continuous operation and uptime at least 99.99% annually.

High availability clusters are groups of servers that support business-critical applications. Applications are run on a primary server and in the event of a failure, application operation is moved to secondary server(s) where they continue to operate.
