# Introduction

This documentation aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of Quality Gates in SonarQube, elucidating their configuration, conditions, metrics, and integration into CI/CD pipelines.A quality gate is a set of conditions that indicates if the project analyzed is "good enough for you or not" to be delivered to the next stage in your software life cycle.Quality Gates considers all of the quality metrics for a project and assigns a passed or failed designation for that project.

# Purpose

The primary purpose of Quality Gates in SonarQube is to enforce and uphold stringent code quality standards throughout the software development process. By defining conditions based on key metrics like code coverage, duplication, and the presence of bugs or security vulnerabilities, Quality Gates empower development teams to identify and rectify issues early in the development lifecycle.

# What is Quality Gates in SonarQube

Quality Gates play a pivotal role in ensuring the integrity and reliability of software projects by serving as a set of predefined criteria that code must meet to be considered acceptable.In the realm of SonarQube, Quality Gates act as a gatekeeper, allowing only code that meets specified standards to progress through the development lifecycle.
