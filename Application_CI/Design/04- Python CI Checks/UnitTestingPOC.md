[Unit testing](https://github.com/avengers-p7/Documentation/blob/main/Application_CI/Design/04-%20Python%20CI%20Checks/UnitTesting.md) is a crucial aspect of software development that involves testing individual units or components of code to ensure their proper functioning. It aims to validate that each unit, such as a function or method, works as intended and produces the expected output. So we are going to use pytest framework to do the unit test

Here we already have the unit test cases written inside the repo by the developer to check the respective Python code.

The test cases are included for the following modules and directories present inside the repo i.e route, client, model & utils

The unit test cases are written in pytest framework
