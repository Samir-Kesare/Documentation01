## Dependency scanning

* Dependency scanning is a process used in software development to identify and analyze the external dependencies or third-party components that a project relies on. These dependencies can include libraries, frameworks, modules, packages, or other code modules that are utilized to build and run the software. 

* The scanning process is typically automated and integrated into the development workflow, often as part of continuous integration or continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines. It serves as a crucial post-build process examines the project's dependencies to identify any known vulnerabilities, outdated versions, or security issues.
