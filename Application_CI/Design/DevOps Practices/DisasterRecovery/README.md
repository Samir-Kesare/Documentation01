## Introduction 
Disaster Recovery (DR) is crucial for organizations to swiftly respond to and recover from events impacting business operations, aiming to minimize downtime and data loss. This process involves a comprehensive analysis of IT infrastructure and the creation of a formal document for crisis management. 

This document covers backing up the database and server directory, and listing installed plugins and configurations. This proactive approach ensures business continuity, data protection, regulatory compliance, and overall resilience in the face of unforeseen events, emphasizing the importance of a robust disaster recovery plan for organizational stability.

## What is Disaster Recovery?
Disaster recovery (DR) is an organization's ability to respond to and recover from an event that negatively affects business operations. The goal of DR is to reduce downtime, data loss and operational disruptions while maintaining business continuity. To prepare for this, organizations often perform an in-depth analysis of their systems and IT infrastructure and create a formal document to follow in times of crisis.

## Why Disater Recovery?
Disaster recovery is essential for organizations to ensure `business continuity, protect valuable data from loss or corruption, mitigate risks, comply with regulations, maintain customer trust and reputation, avoid financial losses, gain a competitive edge, sustain employee productivity, and stabilize supply chains`. It is a crucial strategy to swiftly recover from unexpected events or disasters and minimize the impact on operations.

## How disaster recovery works
Disaster recovery relies on having a solid plan to get critical applications and infrastructure up and running after an outage—ideally within minutes.

An effective DR plan addresses three different elements for recovery: 
| Element | Description |
| ------- | --------------- |
| Preventive | Ensuring your systems are as secure and reliable as possible, using tools and techniques to prevent a disaster from occurring in the first place. This may include backing up critical data or continuously monitoring environments for configuration errors and compliance violations. 
| Detective | For rapid recovery, you’ll need to know when a response is necessary. These measures focus on detecting or discovering unwanted events as they happen in real time. 
| Corrective | These measures are aimed at planning for potential DR scenarios, ensuring backup operations to reduce impact, and putting recovery procedures into action to restore data and systems quickly when the time comes. 

## Types of Disaster Recovery

| Type                          | Description                                                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Backups                       | - Data backed up to an offsite system or external drive.                                                      |
|                               | - Not a full disaster recovery solution as it lacks IT infrastructure.                                      |
| Backup as a Service (BaaS)     | - Regular data backups provided by a third-party provider.                                                    |
| Disaster Recovery as a Service | - Cloud providers offer DRaaS, hosting data and IT infrastructure on a third-party cloud during a crisis.   |
|                               | - Provider implements and orchestrates DR plan for minimal interruption to operations.                       |
| Point-in-time Snapshots        | - Replicates data, files, or an entire database at a specific point in time.                                  |
|                               | - Used for restoring data if stored in an unaffected location, but may incur some data loss.                 |
| Virtual DR                     | - Backs up operations and data, creating a complete replica of IT infrastructure on offsite virtual machines.|
|                               | - Enables quick reload and resumption of operations after a disaster. Requires frequent data transfers.      |
| Disaster Recovery Sites        | - Temporary locations post-disaster, containing backups of data, systems, and technology infrastructure.      |
