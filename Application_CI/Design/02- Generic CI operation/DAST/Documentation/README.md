# Introduction

Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) is a crucial component in ensuring the security of  applications/APIs. In the Python ecosystem, DAST plays a vital role in identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities in web applications. This documentation aims to provide a comprehensive overview of Python DAST, including its definition, purpose, available tools, their comparison, advantages, best practices, and a recommendation for a tool with justifications.

# What is DAST?

Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) is a security testing methodology that focuses on identifying vulnerabilities in running web applications. Unlike Static Application Security Testing (SAST), which analyzes the source code, DAST interacts with the application in real-time to discover security weaknesses. In Python, DAST involves the use of specialized tools to test web applications for common security issues, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and security misconfigurations.

# Why DAST?

It is a security testing approach focused on identifying vulnerabilities in running Python web applications. Unlike static analysis, DAST interacts with the live application, simulating real-world attacks to uncover issues like SQL injection and cross-site scripting. Tools like OWASP ZAP and Nikto are commonly used for Python DAST, offering real-time insights into runtime vulnerabilities, complementing other testing methods, and enhancing overall web application security.
