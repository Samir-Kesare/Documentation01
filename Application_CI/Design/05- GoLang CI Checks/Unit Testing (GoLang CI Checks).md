## Introduction

This document explores conducting unit tests in a Golang app using the standard testing framework provided by the testing package. Pre-written unit tests within the repository cover modules like API, client, config, middleware, and routes. Leveraging this framework ensures code quality and functionality, fostering confidence in the application's reliability.
