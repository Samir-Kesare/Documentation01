Golangci-lint is just a fast linter for Go. Now, a linter is a tool that inspects code files using a set of rules that identify issues that lead to misunderstanding, result in unexpected outcomes, or make the code harder to read. Additionally, linter can aid in identifying potential defects in the code, such as undeclared variable assignment, which can result in runtime errors, retrieving the value from a global variable, which complicates debugging, and other issues.

## Conclusion
we covered the process of installing Go first as a prerequisite. We then covered installation of golangci-lint and finally how can it be configured specifically and then be used in our Go programs to lint our code. By having golangci-lint at our disposal, We can ensure your code is top-notch and easy to understand. With Go and golangci-lint, maintaining great code quality and catching potential issues becomes an integral part of our coding journey.
