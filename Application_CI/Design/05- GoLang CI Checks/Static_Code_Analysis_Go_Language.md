# Static Code Analysis - Go Language 

# What is Static Code Analysis
Static code analysis is a method of debugging that is done by automatically examining the source code without having to execute the program. 
Static code analysis tools attempt to highlight possible vulnerabilities within 'static' (non-dynamic) code. 
These tools are useful as they provide immediate feedback to the developer on issues they might be introducing into the code, which is very useful as compared to finding vulnerabilities much later in the development process. 

# Why we need Static Code Analysis

| Aspects                        | Description                                                                                              |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Early Issue Identification**   | Static code analysis helps in identifying potential issues early in the development process, preventing costly debugging efforts later on. |
| **Code Quality Assurance**      | It ensures code quality by identifying and addressing potential vulnerabilities, security issues, and non-compliance with coding standards. |
| **Improved Security**           | By detecting security vulnerabilities early in the software development life cycle, it helps prevent security breaches and reduces the risk and cost of a security breach. |
| **Efficiency and Cost Savings** | It increases efficiency by reducing the time and effort required for debugging and fixing defects later in the development cycle, leading to productivity gains and cost savings. |
| **Comprehensive Code Evaluation**| It evaluates all the code in an application, increasing code quality and providing a more in-depth analysis compared to manual code review. |
| **Automated and Thorough Analysis** | Static code analysis is usually an automated process that can find vulnerabilities in even the most remote and unattended parts of the code, providing a more thorough analysis. |
