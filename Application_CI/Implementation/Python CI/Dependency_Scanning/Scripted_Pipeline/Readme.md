## Introduction

Declarative Pipeline is a streamlined way to define Jenkins pipelines using a structured syntax within a pipeline {} block. It offers simplicity, readability, and built-in directives for defining stages, steps, and more. It integrates well with the Jenkins UI, provides pipeline visualization, and supports pipeline templates for code reuse. It's ideal for teams looking for a straightforward approach to CI/CD pipeline configuration.

## Why Scripted Pipeline
| Aspect          | Description                                                                                               |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Organization**    | Markdown tables organize pipeline stages, descriptions, and commands into neat columns for easier readability and understanding. |
| **Readability**     | Condenses verbose Declarative Pipeline syntax, particularly beneficial for complex pipelines, enhancing readability and comprehension. |
| **Documentation**   | Integrates pipeline configuration seamlessly into project documentation using Markdown, providing a comprehensive overview of CI/CD processes. |
| **Version Control** | Markdown files are version-controlled with tools like Git, enabling tracking of pipeline changes, revision history, and collaboration. |
| **Accessibility**   | Markdown files are viewable and editable with basic text editors or online Markdown editors, facilitating review and contribution by team members, including non-technical stakeholders. |
| **Presentation**    | Markdown files can be rendered into multiple formats, including HTML, PDF, and slideshows, enabling formatted documents or presentations for sharing and presentation purposes. |
