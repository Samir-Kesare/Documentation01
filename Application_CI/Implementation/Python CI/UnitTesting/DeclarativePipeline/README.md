# Introduction
Testing individual units or components of a software program is a vital part of the software development process, ensuring that each part performs as intended. In this context, we utilize the pytest framework to create unit tests, validating the functionality of specific components. This practice contributes to verifying the overall correctness and reliability of a software application.
