# Introduction

In modern software development, keeping everyone in the loop about code changes is crucial. With Jenkins and its Declarative Pipelines, we can easily set up notifications on Slack to let the team know about build results. By storing our pipeline configuration in a Jenkinsfile on GitHub, we make the process simple and automated, ensuring everyone stays informed about the status of our projects.

# Slack Notification Setup

Setting up Slack notifications in Jenkins involves integrating Jenkins with Slack using a Jenkins plugin and configuring the necessary settings in both Jenkins and Slack.

**Step-1 Workspace Creation**

Different projects or teams may have different Jenkins jobs with unique notification requirements. Using separate workspaces in Slack allows for the isolation and organization of notifications related to specific projects or teams.

Go to the Slack website.Click on "Get started for free" or "Create a new workspace."Follow the prompts to set up your Slack workspace, providing details such as your email address and password.

**Step-2 Channel Creation**

Creating a dedicated channel for Jenkins notifications helps isolate and organize build-related messages.

Log in to your Slack workspace.In the left sidebar, click on the "+" button next to "Channels."Choose "Create a channel."

**Step-3 Jenkins CI Setup**

This step includes the steps for "Password" or "Secret Text" creation,which is an important part for Slack Notification.With this,will get the "Team Subdomain" & "Password" which is needed for jenkins slack notification configuration.

**Step-4 Jenkins Configuration** 

Setting up Jenkins Global Configuration for Slack notifications allows you to centralize and manage Slack-related settings at a global level. This global configuration provides a convenient way to store and share common information, such as Slack team domain and integration tokens, across multiple Jenkins jobs.

Go to "Manage Jenkins" > "Configure System."Scroll down to the "Slack" section.In the "Team Domain" field, enter the Slack team domain.In the "Integration Token Credential" section, click on "Add" to add your Slack integration token as a Jenkins credential.Enter the necessary information, such as the token itself and an ID to identify the credential.In the "Test Connection" section, enter a Slack channel name and click on "Test Connection" to verify that Jenkins can communicate with Slack.

# Pipeline

```shell
pipeline {
    agent any
    
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                script {
                    // Define the DSL for creating a Freestyle job
                    def jobDSL = '''
                        job('My-Freestyle-Job') {
                            description('This is a sample Freestyle job created using a Declarative Pipeline')
                            steps {
                                shell('echo "Hello, world!"')
                            }
                        }
                    '''
                    // Execute the job DSL to create the Freestyle job
                    jobDsl scriptText: jobDSL
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    post {
        success {
            slackSend(color: '#36a64f', message: "Declarative Job completed successfully!", channel: "#jenkins", teamDomain: "demoworkspace-6868926", tokenCredentialId: "e96c6c7f-1fdf-4c4a-80fd-5ad178092678")
        }
        failure {
            slackSend(color: '#ff0000', message: "Declarative Job failed!", channel: "#jenkins", teamDomain: "demoworkspace-6868926", tokenCredentialId: "e96c6c7f-1fdf-4c4a-80fd-5ad178092678")
        }
    }
}

# Conclusion

In summary, integrating Slack notifications with Jenkins through Declarative Pipelines simplifies communication in software teams. With our pipeline configuration stored on GitHub, we streamline the process and ensure everyone receives timely updates on build outcomes. This straightforward approach promotes collaboration and keeps the team aligned, ultimately leading to smoother development cycles and faster problem-solving.
