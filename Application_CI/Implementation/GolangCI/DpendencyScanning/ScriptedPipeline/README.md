## Introduction
This document outlines the integration of GoLang dependency scanning into a Jenkins scripted pipeline, crucial for identifying vulnerabilities. By automating this process, we enhance the security of our GoLang projects within CI/CD workflows. We'll explore using tools like GoSec and Trivy, discussing their benefits and how to implement them effectively. Let's streamline our security practices and safeguard our code with this scripted pipeline solution.

## Why
| Benefits | Explanation |
|----------|-------------|
| **Early Detection of Vulnerabilities**|	Dependency scanning identifies security vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies early, aiding prompt remediation.|
| **Continuous Security Monitoring**| Scanning integrated into pipelines ensures consistent security checks with every build, offering ongoing protection.|
| **Reduced Risk of Exploitation**| Proactively addressing vulnerabilities lowers the risk of exploitation by malicious entities, safeguarding data.|
| **Compliance Requirements** |	Meeting regulatory standards necessitates thorough security measures, easily achievable through scripted pipelines.|
| **Streamlined Development Processes**	| Automation in scripted pipelines optimizes efficiency by seamlessly integrating security practices into workflows.|
