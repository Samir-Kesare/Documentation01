## Introduction
In modern software development, managing dependencies is crucial for code stability and security. This guide explores implementing a Jenkins Declarative Pipeline tailored for GoLang projects, automating dependency scanning to ensure robustness and reliability. By integrating this pipeline, teams can efficiently identify and mitigate dependency-related issues, enhancing code quality and project security seamlessly within their CI/CD workflow.

## Why
| Feature	| Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Automated Dependency Management** | Automates the process of scanning project dependencies within GoLang projects, eliminating the need for manual intervention and reducing the likelihood of errors.|
|**Early Issue Detection** | Enables early detection of dependency-related issues like outdated dependencies, vulnerabilities, or conflicts, allowing prompt resolution to prevent escalation.|
| **Code Quality Assurance**| Ensures that project dependencies meet specified quality standards, contributing to overall code quality and reducing technical debt.|
| **Enhanced Security Posture** | Identifies and mitigates potential security vulnerabilities within project dependencies, minimizing the risk of security breaches or exploits.|
| **Streamlined CI/CD Workflow**| Seamlessly integrates with Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, making dependency scanning a fundamental part of the software delivery process.|
| **Efficient Resource Utilization** | Optimizes resource usage by automating dependency scanning tasks, freeing developers to focus on value-added activities like feature development and innovation.|
| **Compliance Requirements**| Supports compliance needs by offering an auditable trail of dependency scanning activities, facilitating regulatory compliance and industry standards adherence.|
