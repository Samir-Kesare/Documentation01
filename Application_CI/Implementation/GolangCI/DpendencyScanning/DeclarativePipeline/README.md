## Introduction
In modern software development, managing dependencies is crucial for code stability and security. This guide explores implementing a Jenkins Declarative Pipeline tailored for GoLang projects, automating dependency scanning to ensure robustness and reliability. By integrating this pipeline, teams can efficiently identify and mitigate dependency-related issues, enhancing code quality and project security seamlessly within their CI/CD workflow.
***
## Why
| Feature	| Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Automated Dependency Management** | Automates the process of scanning project dependencies within GoLang projects, eliminating the need for manual intervention and reducing the likelihood of errors.|
|**Early Issue Detection** | Enables early detection of dependency-related issues like outdated dependencies, vulnerabilities, or conflicts, allowing prompt resolution to prevent escalation.|
| **Code Quality Assurance**| Ensures that project dependencies meet specified quality standards, contributing to overall code quality and reducing technical debt.|
| **Enhanced Security Posture** | Identifies and mitigates potential security vulnerabilities within project dependencies, minimizing the risk of security breaches or exploits.|
| **Streamlined CI/CD Workflow**| Seamlessly integrates with Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, making dependency scanning a fundamental part of the software delivery process.|
| **Efficient Resource Utilization** | Optimizes resource usage by automating dependency scanning tasks, freeing developers to focus on value-added activities like feature development and innovation.|
| **Compliance Requirements**| Supports compliance needs by offering an auditable trail of dependency scanning activities, facilitating regulatory compliance and industry standards adherence.|

## Features
| Feature |	Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Automated Dependency Scanning** | Utilizes Jenkins Declarative Pipeline to automate the scanning of dependencies within GoLang projects.|
| **Integration with GoLang Tools**| Incorporates GoLang-specific tools and commands (e.g., go list) to analyze project dependencies effectively.|
| **Structured Pipeline Syntax**| Utilizes a structured syntax provided by Jenkins Declarative Pipeline for clear definition and readability.|
| **Built-in Stage Definitions**| Provides built-in stages (stages, steps, post) for defining the different stages of the dependency scanning process.|
|**Error Handling Mechanisms** | Implements error handling mechanisms to gracefully manage failures during dependency scanning execution.|

### Here's the advantages and disadvantages of implementing a Declarative Pipeline for GoLang Dependency Scanning presented in a tabular form:
| Advantages | Disadvantages |
|------------|---------------|
| Simplified Syntax |	Limited Flexibility|
| Declarative pipelines offer a simpler syntax compared to scripted pipelines, making them easier to read, write, and maintain.| Declarative pipelines provide less flexibility compared to scripted pipelines, restricting the ability to implement complex custom logic.|
| Built-in Stages |	Limited Control |
| Declarative pipelines provide built-in stages (stages, steps, post), simplifying the definition of pipeline stages and steps.| May not be suitable for advanced use cases that require fine-grained control over pipeline execution, as declarative pipelines impose certain restrictions.|
| Enforced Best Practices |	Learning Curve |
| Declarative pipelines enforce best practices, ensuring consistent pipeline structure and quality across projects.| Developers may require time to familiarize themselves with the specific syntax and constraints of declarative pipelines, potentially increasing the learning curve.|
| Integration with Jenkins Ecosystem | Less Customization |
|  Integrates seamlessly with other Jenkins features and plugins, allowing for easy customization and extension.| Declarative pipelines offer less customization compared to scripted pipelines, limiting the ability to implement complex or unconventional workflows.|
| Improved Readability and Maintainability | Potentially Bloated Configuration |
| Declarative pipelines promote improved readability and maintainability due to their structured syntax and predefined stages.| Declarative pipelines may result in bloated configuration files for complex pipelines, making them harder to manage and understand.|
