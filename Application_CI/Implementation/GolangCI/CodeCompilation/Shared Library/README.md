# Introduction 
The process of code compilation involves converting high-level programming code, such as Java, C++, or Python, into machine-readable instructions or bytecode. 
This transformation is carried out by a compiler, which is a specialized tool designed to translate human-readable source code into an executable format. Here we are using "go Build" to compile the code.

In this task, we are using Shared Library.

# What is Shared Library 
A shared library is a collection of reusable Groovy scripts that you can share across multiple Jenkins jobs. 
It's like building modular components for your CI/CD pipelines, promoting efficiency and maintainability.
