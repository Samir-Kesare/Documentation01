# What is VPN?

VPN stands for the Virtual Private Network. A virtual private network (VPN) is a technology that creates a safe and encrypted connection over a less secure network, such as the Internet. A Virtual Private Network is a way to extend a private network using a public network such as the Internet. The name only suggests that it is a “Virtual Private Network”, i.e. user can be part of a local network sitting at a remote location. It makes use of tunnelling protocols to establish a secure connection.

# Why VPN

| **Reason** | **Description** |
| ---------- | --------------- |
| **Enhanced Security** | VPNs encrypt data, preventing unauthorized access, and protecting sensitive information such as passwords, financial transactions, and personal communications. |
| **Privacy Protection** | VPNs mask your IP address, making it difficult for websites, advertisers, and third parties to track your online activities and location. | 
| **Secure Remote Access** | VPNs facilitate secure remote access to corporate networks for employees working remotely, ensuring confidentiality and integrity of company data. |
| **Public Wi-Fi Security** | VPNs provide a secure connection on public Wi-Fi networks, protecting users from potential threats such as Wi-Fi spoofing and packet sniffing. |

# Types of VPN

| **Types** | **Description** |
| --------- | --------------- |
| **Remote Access VPN** | Remote Access VPN permits a user to connect to a private network and access all its services and resources remotely. The connection between the user and the private network occurs through the Internet and the connection is secure and private. |
| **Site to Site VPN** | A Site-to-Site VPN is also called as Router-to-Router VPN and is commonly used in the large companies. Companies or organizations, with branch offices in different locations, use Site-to-site VPN to connect the network of one office location to the network at another office location. |
| **Cloud VPN** | A Cloud VPN is a virtual private network that allows users to securely connect to a cloud-based infrastructure or service. It uses the internet as the primary transport medium to connect the remote users to the cloud-based resources. |
| **Mobile VPN** | Mobile VPN is a virtual private network that allows mobile users to securely connect to a private network, typically through a cellular network. It creates a secure and encrypted connection between the mobile device and the VPN server, protecting the data transmitted over the connection. |
| **SSL VPN** | SSL VPN (Secure Sockets Layer Virtual Private Network) is a type of VPN that uses the SSL protocol to secure the connection between the user and the VPN server. It allows remote users to securely access a private network by establishing an encrypted tunnel between the user’s device and the VPN server. |
| **PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol) VPN** | PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol) is a type of VPN that uses a simple and fast method for implementing VPNs. It creates a secure connection between two computers by encapsulating the data packets being sent between them. |
| **L2TP (Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol) VPN** | L2TP (Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol) is a type of VPN that creates a secure connection by encapsulating data packets being sent between two computers. L2TP is an extension of PPTP, it adds more security to the VPN connection by using a combination of PPTP and L2F (Layer 2 Forwarding Protocol) and it uses stronger encryption algorithm than PPTP. |
| **OpenVPN** | OpenVPN is an open-source software application that uses SSL and is highly configurable and secure. It creates a secure and encrypted connection between two computers by encapsulating the data packets being sent between them.OpenVPN can be used to access internal resources such as email, file servers, or databases. |

# How VPN Works

A VPN works by creating a secure encrypted connection between your device and a remote server. This way, your data can travel in secrecy instead of through your internet service provider. A VPN hides your real IP address and encrypts your internet connection to make your browsing safer and more private.

### It’s worth finding out how a VPN works so you can make use of its full potential. Here’s what’s going on behind the scenes :-

| **Step** | **Description** |
| -------- | --------------- |
| **Authentication** | When you connect to a virtual private network service, it authenticates your client with a VPN server. |
| **Encryption** | The server then applies an encryption protocol to all data you send and receive. |
| **Tunneling** | The VPN service creates an encrypted “tunnel” over the internet. That secures the data traveling between you and the VPN server. |
| **Encapsulation** | To ensure each data packet stays secure, a VPN wraps it in an outer packet, which is then encrypted through encapsulation. That is the core element of the VPN tunnel, keeping the data safe during transfer. |
| **Decryption** | When the data arrives at the server, the outer packet is removed through a decryption process. |

# Advantages of VPN

| **Advantage** | **Description** |
| ------------- | ---------------- |
| **Enhanced Security** | VPNs encrypt data transmitted over the internet, ensuring confidentiality and protecting sensitive information from hackers and eavesdroppers. |
| **Privacy Protection** | By masking users' IP addresses and encrypting their internet traffic, VPNs provide anonymity and prevent websites, advertisers, and ISPs from tracking online activities. |
| **Cost-Effective** | VPNs provide a cost-effective solution for businesses to establish secure connections between remote offices and employees without the need for dedicated leased lines. |
| **Improved Performance** | In some cases, VPNs can improve internet performance by bypassing network congestion and optimizing routing paths, resulting in faster speeds and reduced latency. |
