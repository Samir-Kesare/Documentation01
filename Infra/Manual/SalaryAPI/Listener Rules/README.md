## Introduction
**_Load balancing_** in AWS refers to the process of distributing incoming network traffic across multiple servers or resources to ensure high availability and reliability of applications or services. The primary purpose of load balancing is to optimize resource utilization, maximize throughput, minimize response time, and avoid overloading any single resource.

A `load balancer` serves as the single point of contact for clients. Clients send requests to the load balancer, and the load balancer sends them to targets, such as EC2 instances. 

To configure your load balancer, you create `target groups`, and then register targets with your target groups. 

You also create `listeners` to check for connection requests from clients, and `listener rules` to route requests from clients to the targets in one or more target groups.

## Pre-requisites
* Access to the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI with appropriate permissions.

* Understanding of your application's [network requirements](https://github.com/CodeOps-Hub/Documentation/blob/main/Application_CI/Design/09-%20Cloud%20Infra%20Design/Cloud-Infra-Design-Dev.md).

## Steps to setup Listener Rules for Load Balancer
### Step 1: Create target group
  
  1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at _**https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/**_ .
  
  2. In the navigation pane, choose `Target Groups`.

  9. Register targets
     To register instances, choose Register targets. Select one or more instances, enter the default instance port as needed here, it is `8080` and then choose Include as pending below. When         you are finished adding instances, choose Register pending targets.

### Step 2: Add listener rule of load balancer 
  
  1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.
  2. In the navigation pane, choose Load Balancers.
  3. Click on `Dev-ALB`.

  9. Choose **Next.**
  
  10. **Forward to target groups â€“** Choose one or more target groups to forward traffic to. To add target groups choose Add target group. If using more than one target group, select a weight         for each target group and review the associated percentage.
