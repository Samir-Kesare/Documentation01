# Introduction
Redis can be used as a database, cache, streaming engine, message broker, and more.
Redis Cluster provides a way to run a Redis installation where data is automatically sharded across multiple Redis nodes. Redis Cluster also provides some degree of availability during partitionsâ€”in practical terms, the ability to continue operations when some nodes fail or are unable to communicate.
So, with Redis Cluster, you get the ability to:
- Automatically split your dataset among multiple nodes.
- Continue operations when a subset of the nodes are experiencing failures or are unable to communicate with the rest of the cluster.

# Setup Redis Manually
***
## Installing Redis
**Step-1** Launch 3 EC2 Instances
- Sign in to the AWS Management Console.
- Go to the EC2 dashboard.
- Launch a new EC2 instance using an Ubuntu Server AMI (Amazon Machine Image).
- Instance type - t2.medium

**Step-2** Security Group Configuration
- Create 3 new security group.

**Step-3** Connect to your EC2 Instances
- Once the instance is running, connect to it using SSH. The private key associated with the key pair selected at launch will be required.

**Step-4** Install Redis on Each Server
- Update the package index
```Shell
  sudo apt update
```
- Install Redis server
```shell
sudo apt install redis-server
```
- To check whether Redis is running on your server, you can use the following command
```Shell
sudo systemctl status redis-server
```
- Configure Redis Instances
  1. Edit the Redis configuration file in each server:
```shell
sudo nano /etc/redis/redis.conf
```
  2. Find the line `bind 127.0.0.1` and replace it with `bind <server1_IP>`. Replace `<server1_IP>` with the private IP address of the servers.
  3. Find the line `protected-mode yes` and change it to `protected-mode no` to allow external connections.
  4. Find the line `cluster-enabled no` and change it to `cluster-enabled yes`.
  5. Save and close the file.
**Step-5** Restart Redis Service
- Restart the Redis service on each server to apply the configuration changes
```shell
sudo systemctl restart redis-server
```
**Step-6** Verify Configuration
- Check that Redis is running and listening on the correct IP addresses and ports.
```Shell
sudo netstat -tuln | grep 6379
```
