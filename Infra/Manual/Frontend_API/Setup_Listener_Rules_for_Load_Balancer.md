## Introduction

<img width="260" length="100" alt="LB" src="https://github.com/CodeOps-Hub/Documentation/assets/156056413/3a7244d7-a6dc-471b-bd80-bf6d500b02d0"> 

Load balancing in AWS refers to the process of distributing incoming network traffic across multiple servers or resources to ensure high availability and reliability of applications or services. The primary purpose of load balancing is to optimize resource utilization, maximize throughput, minimize response time, and avoid overloading any single resource.

## Why use AWS Load Balancer

| Benefit             | Description                                                                                                                                                                   |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **High Availability**   | Load balancers ensure application availability by distributing traffic across multiple servers. This minimizes downtime by routing requests to healthy instances.         |
| **Scalability**         | Load balancers enable horizontal scaling by dynamically adding or removing servers based on traffic demands. They distribute incoming requests across available resources. |
| **Fault Tolerance**     | Load balancers detect unhealthy instances and route traffic only to healthy ones, improving fault tolerance and reliability.                                                  |
| **Improved Performance** | Load balancers optimize request distribution based on factors like server health, geographic location, and network latency, improving overall application performance.   |
| **SSL Termination**     | Load balancers offload SSL/TLS decryption and encryption tasks, reducing computational overhead on backend servers and enhancing system performance.                         |

## Listener Rules

Listener rules in AWS load balancers determine how incoming traffic is routed to target groups based on request characteristics. Each rule, associated with a listener, prioritizes conditions like HTTP method, path, and source IP address, with lower priority numbers taking precedence. Actions include forwarding to target groups, redirecting, or returning fixed responses. Default rules handle unmatched requests by routing to a default target group or returning an error response.

***
## Importance of Listener Rules

Applications have various use cases in which we have to set up traffic routing based on various factors. Some applications have their setup as distributed microservices where the requests need to serve on the basis of the path to the different services. Sometimes, we may need to use a single load balancer for multiple applications and route the traffic based on the application URLs. These rules provide us a way to design our load balancing strategies according to our use cases and apply them without any complexities.

## Pre-requisites

 * Active Aws Account

## Steps to setup Listener Rules for Load Balancer
### Step 1: Configure a target group
  
  *  Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.
  *  In the navigation pane, choose `Target Groups`.
  *  Choose Create target group.

  *  Choose Create target group.
    
  <img width="800" length="100" alt="LB" src="https://github.com/CodeOps-Hub/Documentation/assets/156056413/0274d078-fed6-419b-9d51-a974fd613279">  
  
  * `Choose a target type` select `Instances` to specify targets by instance ID or IP addresses to specify targets by only IP address.
  * `Target group name` enter a name for the target group.eg `frontend-tg` and Port `3000`.
  * `VPC` select a virtual private cloud (VPC) with the targets that you want to include in your target group.eg `Dev-VPC`
  *  All configurtion default then Choose Next.

### Step 2: Register targets

  * Select one or more instances, enter one or more eg `3000` ports, and then choose Include as pending below.
  * Then Choose Create target group.

### Step 3: Configure a load balancer and a listener
  
  *  Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.
  *  In the navigation pane, choose Load Balancers.
  *  Choose `Create Load Balancer`.

  * Under Application Load Balancer, choose Create.

  * `Load balancer name` enter a name for your load balancer. For example :- `DEV-ALB`.
  * Other  all configuration default .

 * VPC select the VPC that you used for your EC2 instances.eg `DEV-VPC`
 * Mappings enable zones for your load balancer by selecting subnets from two or more Availability Zones.

  * Security groups, select an existing security group, or create a new one. `with 80(HTTP) and 443(HTTPS)` `Frontend-lb-sg`
  * Listeners and routing, the default listener accepts HTTP traffic on port 80. You can keep the default protocol and port, or choose different ones.eg `frontend-tg`.
  * Other  all configuration default .

### Step 4: Test the load balancer

* Select the newly created load balancer.
* Choose Description and copy the DNS name of the internet facing or internal load balancer
* (for example, `Dev-ALB-1442510364.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com`).

  * Paste the DNS name into the address field of an internet connected web browser.
  
> [!NOTE]
> * Please note that before hitting the DNS, the machine active and `npm start` commands should be run.

  * [**DNS**](Dev-ALB-1442510364.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com)
