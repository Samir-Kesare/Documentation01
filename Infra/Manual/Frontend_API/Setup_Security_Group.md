AWS Security Groups are a vital component of AWS's network security and cloud data security. They act as a virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic to and from AWS resources. Each AWS resource, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances or Relational Database Service (RDS) instances, can be associated with one or more security groups.

Security groups operate at the instance level, meaning that they define rules that specify what traffic is allowed to reach the associated resources. These rules can be applied to both incoming and outgoing traffic, providing a granular way to manage access to your AWS resources.
