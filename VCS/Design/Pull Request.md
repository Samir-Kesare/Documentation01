## Introduction 
* A pull request is a proposal to merge a set of changes from one branch into another. This mechanism is fundamental in collaborative software development workflows, allowing team members to thoroughly review and discuss the proposed alterations before incorporating them into the main codebase. 

* The pull request acts as a communication hub where developers can engage in discussions, ask questions, and collaborate to ensure that the proposed changes align with the project's objectives and coding standards.
The primary purpose of this process is to maintain code quality, prevent errors, and promote a more informed decision-making process.

## Pull Requests flow

## PR Creation
### **Step 1: Clone the Repository**
* Use the git clone command with the URL of your forked repository to download a local copy. This copy is where you'll make and test your changes.

***
### **Step 2: Create a Branch**
* Branches isolate changes from the main codebase. Use `git checkout -b branch-name` to create and switch to a new branch. Naming your branch appropriately helps others understand the purpose of your changes.

***
### **Step 3: Make Changes**
* Make necessary code or documentation modifications in your local branch. Ensure your changes align with the purpose of your contribution, whether it's fixing a bug, adding a documentation or any new feature.

***
### **Step 4: Commit Changes**

* Commits save changes with a message describing what was done. Use `git commit -m "your message"` to commit changes. Clear and concise commit messages help collaborators understand your intentions.

***
### **Step 5: Push Changes**

* Pushing uploads your local branch and commits to your forked repository on GitHub. Execute `git push origin branch-name` to push changes. This makes your modifications accessible for creating a pull request.

***
### **Step 6: Create Pull Request**
* A pull request proposes changes to the original repository. Navigate to the original repository, click `New Pull Request`, select your branch, and follow the prompts. Write a clear title and description to help reviewers understand the purpose of your contribution.

### Method 1: Using GUI 

* After making changes and pushing them to the remote repository, you'll be prompted to create a pull request. Take advantage of this prompt by clicking on it.

<img width="937" alt="Screenshot 2024-01-20 at 11 42 04 PM" src="https://github.com/avengers-p7/Documentation/assets/156056349/ab8da8e7-d666-42db-98ba-01893c84a4f5">

* After initiating a pull request, it is valuable to engage with the reviewer by adding a comment to mention the specific changes incorporated into the request. Mentioning the modifications made helps the reviewer understand the intent behind the pull request and promotes a more efficient review process.

### Method 2: Using CLI 

> NOTE: If you wish to create a pull request from the command line interface (CLI), it's essential to have GitHub CLI installed. You can install it by visiting [this link](https://github.com/cli/cli/releases)

* To initiate the creation of a pull request, use the following command in your shell:

```shell
gh pr create
```

* After initiating the pull request, it's beneficial to add a comment.

* You can check the status of your pull request by viewing the list of pull requests. This allows you to confirm whether the pull request has been successfully raised or not

```shell
gh pr list
```

## Closing Pull Requests

### Method 1: Using GUI 

* After successful review and approval, the pull request is merged. Contributors should delete their feature branches after merging to keep the repository clean.

<img width="998" alt="Screenshot 2024-01-19 at 7 51 44 PM" src="https://github.com/avengers-p7/Documentation/assets/156056349/8f7d17b0-bf71-4019-8a3f-76dcec5b388d">

### Method 2: Using CLI

* To close a pull request from the command line interface (CLI) using GitHub CLI, you can use the following command:

```shell
gh pr close <pull-request-number>
```

<img width="767" alt="Screenshot 2024-01-21 at 2 44 55 AM" src="https://github.com/avengers-p7/Documentation/assets/156056349/bc55365b-33ad-4932-9370-6de8ade34f01">

* To reference a particular branch, utilize the --head option for the branch where modifications are made and the --base option for the branch into which you intend to merge your changes.

<img width="1077" alt="Screenshot 2024-01-22 at 4 04 33 PM" src="https://github.com/avengers-p7/Documentation/assets/156056349/9fe1e7fd-178d-4f51-863a-c3755f41ba33">


***
## Conflict Resolution 

* A conflict in a pull request arises when changes made in the source branch conflict with the changes made in the target branch . Consider two developers, A and B, each working on a separate feature branch, feature-A and feature-B. Both branches aim to introduce changes to the same file (eg. README.md).In this situation, Git cannot automatically determine which changes to apply.
* Follow these steps to resolve conflicts during the merge process:

### 1. Identify Conflict:
* Locate conflicted files marked with <<<<<<<, =======, and >>>>>>>.

### 2. Review Changes:
* Understand conflicting changes from both branches.

### 3. Resolve Conflict:
* Manually edit files to keep, discard, or combine changes.

### Commit and Push:
* Add, commit, and push resolved changes.

**Example Conflict:**
